Erika was a great host and really extended herself to make sure I was comfortable and felt welcome. Her apartment is absolutely lovely, spacious, very clean and tidy, as is the room. The apartment is just a few steps away from subway stations, restaurants and a great grocery store. Staying with Erika and her son was a wonderful experience; they are both lovely people. I had a great stay and would highly recommend.\r\n\r\nAlso, Erica makes a mean cup of Italian coffee.  If you stay with her, don't miss it! "},

Erika is an awesome host (thank you again for the great conversation and the coffee), her house is a 5 minute walk to the ABCD trains, and there are so many great places to visit in her neighborhood. I stayed with Erika for 8 days, and my stay was exactly what I needed: a safe, quiet place to sleep that is not too far away from my job/school and close to public transportation. Thank you again Erika!"},

Not only was her apartment and the room amazing, but Erika went above and beyond making me feel at ease and welcomed. She made a nice breakfast and killer coffee, and she even woke up before sunrise just to ensure I didn't sleep through my alarm for an early flight! \n\nBeyond being a great host,  Erika is one of the most honest and thoughtful people I've ever had the fortune of meeting. I will certainly be visiting, if not staying with, her the next time I'm in NY!"},
